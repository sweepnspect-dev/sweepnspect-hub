      "diagnosis": "Camera permission regression in v2.4.1. The new photo capture module does not re-request CAMERA permission after app update on Android 14+. The permission grant survives the update but the runtime check fails because the new module uses a different permission check path.",
      "proposedFix": "In CameraModule.kt, replace the deprecated checkSelfPermission call with the new ActivityResultContracts.RequestPermission API. This is a 3-line fix in the capture() method. Patch already tested on emulator.",
